# Data Science Notes

### Introduction

I am *Katherine G. Pe*, a software engineer with about a decade experience in software development. In recent years, I have been studying Computer Science (post-graduate degrees). It's a rather broad field of study, so I have decided to focus on learning Data Science for Finance and GIS industry, but not exclusively on how to use Data Science knowledge for such industries.

A lot of my notes are **for absolute beginners** so anyone should be able to read these notes and understand them. You will find elementary-level Mathematical concepts, as well programming concepts which I find useful for Data Science.
