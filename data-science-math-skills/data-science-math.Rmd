# Data Science Math Skills

## Course Information

Data Science Math Skills by **Duke University** is a online course you can take on this site  [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills).


## Motivation for Learning & Re-learning

A lot of graduate school students struggle with Data Science courses only because of their lack of knowledge and/or understanding of Mathematics for Data Science. The course gives an overview of Mathematical concepts you will encounter while learning Data Science.


## Supplemental Notes and Videos

Here's how I make my notes:

My notes include videos from Khan Academy and other websites. The content's the same, and often a bit better due to lack of errors. The text are usually from the Coursera video transcripts.

I indicate **why** it is important to learn such concepts through **Further Reading** notes.


## Sets and What They're Good For



### Set Basics and Vocabulary

* [Set Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/)
* [Set Theory Operations](https://brilliant.org/wiki/set-theory/)


#### Further Reading

> A set is the fundamental discrete structure on which all other discrete structures are built.

Those who studied Discrete Mathematics or read a book about it will probably just re-learn a lot from this course on Set Basics.

* [Applications of Set Theory in Computer Science](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-applications-of-set-theory-in-computer-science/answer/Joshua-Gross-8) - A list of the most obvious applications of Set Theory.
* [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050) - I read most of the book as a supplemental material for a Discrete Math course. The book clearly states why a set is the foundational structure in Computer Science.


### Venn Diagrams

* [What are Venn diagrams?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zt7rk7h/revision)


#### Further Reading

* [A Visual Explanation of SQL Joins](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/)



## The Infinite World of Real Numbers

* [What are Real Numbers?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YwrcJxEbZw)
* [Multi-step Inequalities](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/one-variable-linear-inequalities/multi-step-inequalities/v/multi-step-inequalities)



## The Jagged S Symbol

* [Sigma/Summation Notation](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/sipa/math/summation.html)

    $$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^{2}$$

* The Sigma has similarities to the [factorial](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/prob-comb/combinatorics-precalc/v/zero-factorial-or-0) symbol, but it suggests that you add the values of *i* based on the stopping point *n*

* [Graph-based Machine Learning](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/graph-based-machine-learning-6e2bd8926a0)


## Descartes Was Really Smart

### Plotting Points

* The x-axis is going to be the set of all points x-y in the Cartesian plane, x-y in R2, such that their y coordinate is zero.

* We divide the Cartesian plane into four separate regions, and these we call **quadrants**.

* [Coordinate plane: quadrants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1op92ojA6q0)

### Distance Formula

* [Distance formula](http://www.ccimath.ca/distance-formula.html)

    $$d = \sqrt{ (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 }$$


### Point-Slope Formula for Lines

* [Point Slope Form](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/point-slope/a/point-slope-form-review)

    $$y-b=m(x-a)$$

* [Calculating the Slope](http://cls.syr.edu/mathtuneup/grapha/Unit4/Unit4a.html)

    $$(y2-y1/x2-x1)$$



### Slope-Intercept Formula

* [Slope Intercept Equation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/point-slope/v/point-slope-and-slope-intercept-form-from-two-points)

    $$y=mx+b$$



## Input-Output Machines


### Functions: Mapping from Sets to Sets

* [Functions on Sets - UCLA](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~radko/circles/lib/data/Handout-759-870.pdf)

    $$f: A \rightarrow B$$


### Functions: Graphing in the Cartesian Plane

* [Functions on a Coordinate Plane](https://www.ck12.org/algebra/functions-on-a-coordinate-plane/lesson/Functions-on-a-Cartesian-Plane-BSC-ALG/)

* [Vertical line test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_line_test)

* The **vertical line** test says: *any vertical line, intersects the graph of a function once*. If it intersects it more than once, we violate things here.


### Increasing and Decreasing Functions

* A function is increasing whenever:

    $$a < b$$

    $$f(a) < f(b)$$

    $$f(x) = 2^x - \text{An example of an increasing function}$$

* A function is decreasing whenever:

    $$a > b$$

    $$f(a) > f(b)$$

    $$g(x) = 3^{-x} - \text{An example of a decreasing function}$$


### Composition and Inverse

* [How to find the inverse of a composite function](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/59929/how-to-find-inverse-of-a-composite-function)
* [Evaluating Composite functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oORnGaJp1pk)
* Not every function has an inverse.
* If the graph of *f* fails the *horizontal line test*, the graph has no inverse.


## This is about that derivative stuff

* Formulas:

    $$f'(x) = 2x$$

    $$f(x) = x^{2}$$


## Fast Growth, Slow Growth


### Using Integer Exponents

* 0 as an exponent:

    $$2^{0}=1$$

* Negative exponents:

    $$x^{-n}=1/x^{n}$$

* [Scientific Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwmJ5nMmigQ)


### Simplification Rules for Algebra using Exponents

* Multiplication rule

    $$x^{n}x^{m} = x^{(n+m)}$$

* Power to a power

    $$(x^{n})m = x^{nm}$$

* Product to a power

    $$(xy)^{n} = x^{n}y^{n}$$

* Fraction to a power

    $$\frac{x}{y}^{n} = \frac{x^{n}}{y^{n}}$$

* Division and negative powers

    $$\frac{x^{n}}{x^{n}} = x^{n-m}$$

* Fractional exponents

    $$x^{(\frac{a}{b})} = ^{b} \sqrt{x^{a}}$$


### How Logarithms & Exponents are Related

* [Intro to logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/introduction-to-logarithms/v/logarithms)

* Exponential form:

    $$b^{x} = N$$

* Logarithmic form:

    $$x=log_{b} = N$$

* The logarithm of any base of 1 is 0, just as any number raised to 0 is 1.

* [Solving Logarithmic Equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxD6ZFbu01c): This video was more helpful in understanding how to solve for *x* on a Logarithmic equation problem.


#### General rules

* Product rule

    $$log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)$$

* Quotient rule

    $$log\frac{x}{y}  = log(x) - log(y)$$


* Power and root rule

    $$log(x^{n}) = n log(x)$$

#### Further Reading

* One of the most popular concepts in Data Science is in its logarthmic form (*ln*): [Logistic Regression](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Multivariable/BS704_Multivariable8.html)

* Watch more about [Simple Logistic Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Po-xZJflPM)

### Change of Base


* The base of **10**, **2** and the natural log *(e)* are common in Data Science.

* Formula for changing the base:

    $$log_{a}(b) = \frac{log_{x}(b)}{log_{x}(a)}$$

### The Rate of Growth of Continuous Processes

* Exponential rate of growth can be a **discrete** exponential rate of growth or a **continuous** exponential rate of growth.

* Note: those who studied Finance will likely see the practicality of knowing, but not of the terms of themselves.

* Discrete rate of growth:

    $$1.00(1 + r)t$$

* [Euler's contstant *e*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant))

* What is *e*?

    $$2.71828$$

* Euler is pronounced *Oyler*. He's a mathematician most famously known of his solution to the graph theory problem: [Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg)

* Problem: A baby elephant weighing 200 kg grows at a continuously compounded rate of 5%/year. How much does it weigh in 3 years?

    $$(200 kg)e^{(0.05)(3)} = 232.4 kg$$


## Basic Probability Definitions

### Probability Definitions and Notation

#### Definition

* Probability is the degree of belief in the truth or falsity of a statement.
* When I am certain that a statement is true then that statement is assigned probability **1** and if I'm certain the statement is false,
 then it's assigned probability is **0**.


#### Notation

* The probability of x:

    $$P(x)$$

* The negation of statement x:

    $$~x$$

#### Law of excluded middle

* Probability of a statement and the probability of the negation of a statement must sum to 1.

    $$P(x) + P(~x) = 0$$

#### Principle of indifference

* For the *i-th* outcome *xi* in a distribution with *n* possible outcomes.


    $$P_{xi} = \frac{1}{n}$$


    $$P\text{(event)} = \frac{\text{number of outcomes as defined in event}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes in universe}}$$

### Permutations and Combinations

#### Permutations

* Order matters
* Example:

    $$\text{placing five people in five different positions: 120 ways}$$

* [Permutations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqQTXW7XfYA)

* Formula:

    $$\frac{n!}{(n - m)!}$$


#### Combinations

* Order does not matter
* Example:

    $$\text{forming a five-person team from five people: 1}$$


* [Combinations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKy-d5_erhI)

* Formula:

    $$\frac{n!}{r! (n - r)}$$

#### Replacement

* Sampling *with replacement* (independent), e.g. drawing a card and putting it back in the deck

* Sampling *without replacement*, e.g. drawing a card from a deck and not putting it back


### Using Factorial and "M choose N"


#### Factorial

* A factorial is the operation where we take a number and multiply it by each integer that is 1 less until we get down to 1.


#### "m choose n"

* Draw *n* items from a group of *m* items without replacement.

    $${m\choose n} = \frac{m!}{ ( m - n)! n!}$$


#### Further Reading

* This is a recap of Discrete Mathematics. Try to read  [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050).


### The Sum Rule, Conditional Probability, and the Product Rule


#### Marginal probabilities and the sum rule


#### Sum rule

* The marginal probability is equal to the sum of the joint probabilities.

    $$P_{(x1)} = P_{(x1, y1)} + P_{(x1, y2)} + P_{(x1, y3)}$$

* Sum rule for binary probability distribution:

    $$P(A) = P(A, B) + P(A, \mathtt{\sim}B)$$

* Sum rule for series of n probabilities:

    $$P(A) = P(A, B1) + P(A, B2) + ... + P(A, B_n)$$

####  Conditional probability

* The probability that a statement is true given that some other statement is true with certainty.

    $$P(A \mid B)$$

    $$\text{Probability of A given that B is true with certainty.}$$

    $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{\text{relevant outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes remaining in universe, when B is true}}$$

#### Product Rule

* Formula:

    $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A, B)}{P(B)}$$


## Applying Bayes Theorem and Binomial Theorem


### Bayes Theorem

* Used for **inverse probability problems**.

* The formula:

    $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)}$$
